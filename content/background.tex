\chapter{Terminology}
\label{chapter:background}

In this chapter we introduce the terms and concepts used in the remainder of this work. In \nref{sec:dependability} we introduce the background for dependability theory from related work. In \nref{sec:software_environment_terminology} we introduce our terminology model for the microservice architectural style. Since we did not find a comprehensive model in related work, we define this terminology model ourselves.
