# What?

My master thesis in latex. Based on a template from [Peter Tr√∂ger](http://www.troeger.eu/teaching).

Read a blog post about the thesis on http://freenerd.de/masters-thesis/

# How to build

With pdflatex. With MacTex: `texdist "pdflatex master_thesis.tex"`. And there is probably some bibtex magic involved, but who understands that anyways?
